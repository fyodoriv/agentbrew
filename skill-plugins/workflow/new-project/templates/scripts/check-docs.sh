# Docs drift check: fails when docs and code disagree.
# 1. Every docs/*.md file has a row in docs/README.md.
# 2. Every story test (tests/e2e/us-* or, for pytest, tests/e2e/test_us*) named in docs/user-stories.md exists, and each one is named there.
# 3. Each story test names its story id inside (tests/e2e/us-01-x.sh says US-01), so a renamed
#    or moved test cannot drift silently.
#    Helpers and fixtures in tests/e2e/ without the us- prefix are ignored.
# 4. AGENTS.md stays under 10000 bytes, so the commit that grows it past the limit fails.
